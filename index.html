<h1>The Gamecube</h1>
<p>The Nintendo Gamecube is often considered a rather large failure by the Nintendo corporation. On the contrary some see it as rather successful, bringing in new hit classics or reskinning an older character for a brand new adventure. most of it's success stemmed from it's prime to its decline as many consoles experience.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube</a> because it was also and informative type of website about the same topic. this website uses other types of code elements other than HTML, the first thing that I saw that stood out to me was "client-js" which I felt meeant that JavaScript was active. there are borders used for order and style and different colors in the page to make it look more appealing. over all I think the layout of my website to theirs is slightly similar but the differences are still major. this is obviously a very well crafted web page.</p>
